# Door Knocker Mod
Hello! And thanks for visiting the GitHub repository of my Fabric Minecraft mod: Door Knocker.

Curseforge page: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/door-knocker

Basically this mod adds one thing:

The ability to knock on doors and trapdoors.

This can change the world for role playing users and can also just be a nice thing to have when playing with friends!

Hope you enjoy!

You can fork this source and customize it if you'd like, have fun!
